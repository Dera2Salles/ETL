# Python Data Analysis Project

## Description

This project appears to be focused on data analysis using Python. It utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration and a Python script for streamlined execution of the analysis. The data source seems to be an Excel file named `dataset_account.xlsx`.

## Project Structure

- `python-DA.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook, likely containing the main data analysis, exploration, and visualizations.
- `python-script.ipynb`: A secondary Jupyter Notebook, perhaps for testing, scripting, or a different phase of the analysis.
- `python-script.py`: A standalone Python script. This might be a cleaned, production-ready version of the analysis developed in the notebooks.
- `dataset_account.xlsx`: The primary dataset for this analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need Python installed, along with several data science libraries. You can likely install them using pip. A `requirements.txt` file is recommended for listing dependencies.

You can install these with the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv your_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1.  **Run the final script:**
    - Execute the Python script from your terminal:
      ```bash
      python python-script.py
      ```
